Git commit message best practices:

1. Use a clear structure: Start with a concise subject line (50 chars max), followed by a blank line and detailed description if needed

2. Write in imperative mood: "Add feature" not "Added feature"

3. Begin with a capital letter and don't end with a period

4. Be specific about what changed and why

5. Consider using conventional commits format: type(scope): message
   - feat: new feature
   - fix: bug fix
   - docs: documentation changes
   - style: formatting changes
   - refactor: code restructuring
   - test: adding tests
   - chore: maintenance tasks

This structured approach makes your commit history more readable and useful for collaboration.
